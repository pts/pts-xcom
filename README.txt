pts-xcom: DOS COM encoder for the Universal ASCII message

xcom.com converts a DOS COM executable file to an equivalent, self-decoding
COM file, with only ASCII bytes (codes 32..126) and CRLF (code 13, then 10).

If you speak Hungarian, see the description in xcom_hu.txt .

An explanation of how it could be done:

A similar project which produces DOS EXE executables with only ASCII bytes:
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom7/abc/paper.pdf . It also contains an explanation
of how it can be done.
